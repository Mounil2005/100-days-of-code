# 🔗 URL Shortener - Day 32 (100 Days of Code)

This is a simple URL Shortener app built using **Python** and **Streamlit** as part of my [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/your-username/100-days-of-code) challenge.

The app takes a long URL and returns a shortened version using the **TinyURL** service via the `pyshorteners` library.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Convert long URLs into short ones
- 📋 Copy or open the shortened URL directly
